## Some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<div style="background-color: red;">This is a red div</div>
<script>
function sayHello() {
  alert("Hello, world!");
}
</script>

```
This code will create a simple HTML page with a heading, a paragraph, a red div, and a JavaScript function that will alert the user with the message "Hello, world!".

To run this code, you can save it as a `README.md` file in your GitHub repository. Then, you can open the file in a web browser.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
